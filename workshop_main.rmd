# Don't make me think!
* Make it simple
* No more than 6 types lines or markers
* Some people are color blind
* Do exploratory plots fast but fine tune selected plots for presentation.




## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
